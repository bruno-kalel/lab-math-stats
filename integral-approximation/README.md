# integral-approximation

## Introduction

This repository provides an introduction to numerical integration methods, focusing on Riemann Sums and the Trapezoidal Rule, implemented in Python.

The main goal is to understand how these methods work and how they can be applied to obtain approximations for definite integrals. The methods covered include Riemann Sums and the Trapezoidal Rule.

## Content

- Introduction to numerical integration methods.
- Detailed explanation of Riemann Sums.
